# Summary
[farmaperte-server](https://github.com/marcolino/farmaperte-server/) is the server side of an openâ€‘source project for a general-purpose web app implementing a showcase site , with optional ecommerce (currently using Stripe service for payments), users authentication and handling.
It is strictly coupled with [farmaperte-client](https://github.com/marcolino/farmaperte-client/), the client project.

# Features
- Production-ready APIs
- Data Model
- Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Microservices Support
- Continuous GitHub Sync
- TypeScript and Node.js Source Code
- Plugin System
- Monorepo or Polyrepo
- Custom Code
- Admin UI
- farmaperte-server Console & CLI


# Technology
  ### on the server:
  - node.js
  ### on the client:
  - ...


# Services


# Dependencies


## For the server:
 - node.js
 - npm
 - git-crypt

## For the client
 - npm

> Note: for tests we depend on chai 4.*, because it is the last version compatible with CommonJS, and the whole project is CommonJS.


# Installation
 - npm install -g yarn
 - yarn
...


# Configuration

 - Copy .env.template to .env, and insert all keys values; if you prefer to use different services, feel free to change corresponding keys, and relevant code too.
 - Use `scripts/githubUploadSecrets.js` to upload .env secrets to github, so that github actions can complete.


# Tests Coverage
[Mocha unit+e2e tests coverage](https://marcolino.github.io/farmaperte-server/coverage/index.html) 


# Getting Started

You can get started with farmaperte-server immediately on the farmaperte-server Cloud. 

Alternatively you can set up a local development environment.

See the [farmaperte-server Website](http://farmaperte-server.com/) or [farmaperte-server Docs](http://docs.farmaperte-server.com/) for more details.


## Tutorials 

- [To-do Application using farmaperte-server and React](https://docs.farmaperte-server.com/tutorials/react-todos/)


## farmaperte-server Cloud (SaaS)

Launch farmaperte-server from [farmaperte-preod.fly.dev](https://farmaperte-preod.fly.dev/)


## Development Environment (Local)


### System Requirements
ðŸ’¡ Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js v16 or above](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)


### Getting Started With Local Development

farmaperte-server is using a monorepo with multiple apps and libraries.

Follow these simple instructions to set up a local development environment.

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/marcolino/farmaperte-server.git
  cd farmaperte-server
  yarn install
  ```

2. Run the [setup script](https://github.com/farmaperte-server/farmaperte-server/blob/master/scripts/setup.js), which takes care of installing dependencies, building packages and ensuring your workspace is dev-ready.

  ```bash
  yarn setup:dev
  ```

3. Spin up all required infrastructure (Postgres, Kafka, etc.) using Docker Compose:

  ```bash
  # To be able to view logs
  yarn docker:dev

  # Or, if you prefer to run it in background
  yarn docker:dev -- -d
  ```

4. Apply database migrations:

  ```bash
  yarn db:migrate:deploy
  ```

5. Setup environment

  After cloning the repo, original environment secrets will be downloaded too, in ./.env file.
  You can delete it, it is the environment secrets of the owner, who has the key to unencrypt it.
  Then, if you don't have it, install git-crypt (on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt-get install git-crypt`),
  and then initialize it in your repo: `git-crypt init`.
  Please copy the generated key to some safe folder or device: `git-crypt export-key /SAFE-DEVICE/git-crypt-key`.
  Now please copy .env.template file to .env (it's the .env file with the keys and the comments, but without the values), and fill it up completely, following the comments; you'll have to set up passwords, or keys for services.
  The .env file is listed in .gitattributes, so it will be encrypted before being pushed to remote repository.
  Now, you will have your .env file clear text on your local machine, and encrypted on the remote.
  If you'll have to clone the repo in the future on a new machine, simply do `git-crypt unlock /SAFE-DEVICE/git-crypt-key`, and the .env file will be unencrypted.

6. To start developing, run the `start-dev` target of the desired app:

  ```bash
  # This will start the farmaperte-server Server in development mode
  yarn start-dev 
  ```

+ **Please note that in order to be able to run the app's client properly, you need to `yarn start-dev` both on the server and on client.**

That's it, you are good to go! Happy hacking! ðŸ‘¾
